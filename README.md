Scalate: The Write Less Do More Scala Templating Engine
==============
A Scalate Presentation and accompanying code samples.
--------------
Learn how Scalate provides a common framework supporting several templating syntaxes, how to write testable templates that yell at you when you leave out important structural markup, and how to write html transformers using css3 selectors -- enabling you to turn design mockups into reusable programmatic views without writing any html yourself.
